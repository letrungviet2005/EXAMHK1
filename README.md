Hello, I'm Viet, this is my first Java project while studying at VKU Vietnam university. The project is called Revenue Management and is true to its name because the project operates mainly on the inventory of orders, import and export orders and payments for orders. I have designed my own algorithm that allows you to summarize data in the most accurate and intuitive way through column charts, and I use the date time library in java to make statistics much more accurate. If you want to try the Demo version, the first thing you need to do is pin the project to ecipse through the Revenue Management file, then run the sql text file through your SQL and then run the project in the TrangDangNhap class, I have a test account. created since the project started with account as test and password also as test, you can try. Good luck.
