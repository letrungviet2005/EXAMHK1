Hello, I'm Viet, this is my first Java project while studying at VKU Vietnam university. The project is called Revenue Management and it is true to its name because the project operates mainly on the inventory of orders, import and export orders and payments for orders. I have designed it to allow you to summarize data in the most accurate and intuitive way through column charts, and I use the date and time library in java for much more accurate statistics. If you want to try the Demo version, the first thing you need to do is pin the project to ecipse through the Revenue Management file, then run the sql text file through your SQL and then run the project in the TrangDangNhap class, I have a test account. created since project start with account as test account and password also as test, you can try. Good luck.
