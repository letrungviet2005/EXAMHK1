Hi, I'm Viet, this is my first Java project when I was studying at VKU Vietnam university. The project is called Revenue Management and is true to its name as the project operates mainly based on inventorying the number of orders, importing and exporting orders and paying for orders. I have designed my own algorithm that allows you to summarize data in the most accurate and intuitive way through a column chart. If you want to try the Demo version, the first thing you need to do is pin the project to ecipse through the Revenue Management file, then run the sql text file through your SQL and then run the project in the TrangDangNhap class, I have 1 The test account has been created since the project started with the account as test and the password is also test, you can try it. Good luck.
